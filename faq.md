## Q: Why are open source tools for diabetes important?
By providing open source tools for diabetes, the Glucosio Project hopes to create a framework that other developers with or without diabetes can contribute to and add support for various third-party services that will help diabetics better manage their diabetes and have better health outcomes.

## Q: Will my data be safe in the Glucosio app?
Yes and this is one of the reasons we saw the need for an open source solution so anyone could analyze our code and see how it works. While the app will let you eventually connect with third-party services or even share anonymized statistics and demographics with academic researchers, all of this will be opt-in and absent you opting-in, none of your data leaves your device. We want users to be completely in control with what data they choose to connect to third-party services or share. Ultimately, if you choose not to connect to these services or opt-in to academic research opportunities we still will offer you a feature rich app.

## Q: Will this app have advertisements other forms of monetization?

Absolutely not. Our team is contributing to the project with no financial motivation
but instead a motivation of helping people improve their health outcomes.
