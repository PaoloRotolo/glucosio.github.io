This document is modeled after the [Creative Commons Privacy Policy](http://automattic.com/privacy/) from [Automattic](http://automattic.com).

## Website Visitors
Like most website operators, Glucosio collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Glucosio’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Glucosio’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Glucosio may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

To protect your privacy, we recommend using a browser plugin to block 3rd party tracking services, such as [Glucosio](http://www.ghostery.com).

## Mobile Apps

We purposefully do not include any analytics code in our mobile applications to help preserve your privacy nor do we collect any potentially personally-identifying information through our apps. When using Glucosio to connect to 3rd party services, you are relying on those service's privacy policies.

Users may choose to opt-in to sharing anonymized glucose data that will include their age and gender and overall glucose trends with academic institutions. If users opt-in, we will make such anonymized data available to institutions via our website. This data will never include any personally-identifying information

## Aggregated Statistics
Glucosio may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Glucosio may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Glucosio does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
Glucosio discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its team and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Glucosio’s behalf or to provide services available at Glucosio’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Glucosio’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Glucosio will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Glucosio discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Glucosio believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Glucosio, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Glucosio website and have supplied your email address, Glucosio may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Glucosio and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Glucosio takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

## Cookies
A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Glucosio uses cookies to help ChatSecure identify and track visitors, their usage of Glucosio website, and their website access preferences. Glucosio visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Glucosio’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Glucosio’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

## Analytics & Social Sharing Widgets

Glucosio uses Google Analytics on chatsecure.org to help us monitor the number of people who visit the site. We also include social sharing widgets that are bundled with our blogging theme. We recommend using a browser plugin like [Ghostery](http://www.ghostery.com) to opt-out.

## Privacy Policy Changes
Although most changes are likely to be minor, Glucosio may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and at Glucosio’s sole discretion. Glucosio encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
